## **Use Case Scenarios**
1. **Playing VLC File:**
   - **Input:** "sample.vlc"
   - **Expected Output:** The adapter uses `VLCPlayer` to play the file.
   
2. **Playing MP4 File:**
   - **Input:** "sample.mp4"
   - **Expected Output:** The adapter uses `MP4Player` to play the file.
   
3. **Unsupported Format:**
   - **Input:** "sample.avi"
   - **Expected Output:** Error message indicating the format is not supported.

## **Code Walkthrough**
1. **MediaPlayer Interface:**
   - Defines the `play()` method that all concrete classes must implement.
   
2. **VLCPlayer and MP4Player:**
   - Implement their respective play methods.
   
3. **MediaAdapter Class:**
   - Acts as a bridge between `MediaPlayer` and `AdvancedMediaPlayer`.

4. **AudioPlayer Class:**
   - Uses the adapter to support multiple formats.

## **How to Run**
1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile and run the `AdapterPatternDemo` class.
3. Provide different file types and observe how the adapter switches between different player implementations.

## **Conclusion**
The Adapter Pattern is ideal for enabling two incompatible interfaces to work together without modifying existing code.
