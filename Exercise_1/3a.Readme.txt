## **Use Case Scenarios**
1. **Single Instance:** 
   - If the configuration is accessed from multiple points in the application, all should reference the same instance.
   
2. **Updating Configuration:**
   - If a configuration setting is updated from one instance, it should reflect in all other parts of the application.

3. **Lazy Initialization:**
   - The configuration object is created only when accessed for the first time.

## **Code Walkthrough**
1. **ConfigurationManager Class:**
   - The `ConfigurationManager` class has a private constructor to prevent direct instantiation.
   - The `getInstance()` method ensures that only one instance is created.
   
2. **getConfigSetting() and setConfigSetting():**
   - These methods allow accessing and modifying the configuration setting.
   
## **How to Run**
1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile and run the `SingletonPatternDemo` class.
3. Observe that changes made from any point in the application are consistent across all references to the `ConfigurationManager` object.

## **Edge Cases and Solutions**
1. **Multiple Threads Instantiating the Singleton:**
   - **Solution:** Use `synchronized` or double-checked locking to ensure thread safety.

## **Conclusion**
The Singleton Pattern is ideal for scenarios requiring a single global instance, such as configurations or logging. This implementation ensures thread safety and lazy initialization.
